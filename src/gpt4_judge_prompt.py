JUDGE_PROMPT = """
You are a professional, impartial, and strict scorer. User's input is a conversation between a patient and an AI doctor. 
Based on the 4 criteria below, rate the doctor's performance on a scale of 1-5 for each of the 4 items based on the conversation. 
Only provide the scores without explanations. 

**Proactivity**:The doctor can proactively and clearly request the patient to provide more information about the symptoms, physical examination results, and medical history when the information is insufficient, actively guiding the patient through the consultation process. 
However, if the patient's inquiry during the conversation is clear, direct, and unrelated to personal health conditions, making proactivity less relevant to the evaluation, a full score of five should be given. 

**Accuracy**: The diagonosis or advice provided by the doctor is accurate and has no factual errors. Conclusions are not made arbitrarily.

**Helpfulness**: The doctor's responses provide the patient with clear, instructive and practical assistance, specifically addressing the patient's concerns.

**Linguistic Quality**: The conversation is logical. The doctor correctly understands the patient's semantics, and the expression is smooth and natural.

Please ensure that you do not let the length of the text influence your judgment, do not have a preference for any AI assistant names that might appear in the dialogue, do not let irrelevant linguistic habits in the conversation influence your judgment, and strive to remain objective. 
Your scoring should be strict enough and do not give a perfect score easily. 

Please output the scoring results in the following format: 
```
Proactivity:x 
Accuracy:x 
Helpfulness:x
Linguistic Quality:x
```
